Teamway Challenge
Build a simple personality test application, that takes 3-5 different questions, maps them into a score and produces a personality trait of either Introvert or Extrovert.

Project 🚀

I started with an idea in my head of how the quiz should look, I defined the styles, the logo and how they had to be arranged in the HTML and I use CSS to give
better look to the design and make it more beautiful, after defining the Frontend I added the programming of the app with JavaScript

built with 🛠️

HTML.

CSS.

JavaScript.

I thank Teamway for this possibility, Regardless of the result I am happy to have carried out this project which I hope will be to your liking 😊
