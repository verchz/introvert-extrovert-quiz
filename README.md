Teamway Challenge
Build a simple personality test application, that takes 3-5 different questions, maps them into a score and produces a personality trait of either Introvert or Extrovert.

I started with an idea in my head of how the quiz should look, I defined the styles, the logo and how they had to be arranged in the HTML and i use CSS to give
better look to the design and make it more beautiful, after defining the Frontend I added the programming of the app with Javascript

built with 🛠️
HTML.
CSS.

I thank Teamway for this possibility, Regardless of the result I am happy to have carried out this project which I hope will be to your liking 😊
